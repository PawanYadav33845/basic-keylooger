# basic-keylooger

This a basic keylogger built in python and all it does is log all your keystrokes in a text file named keyfile.txt.
After the code is run all it does is capture your keystrokes and log it.
As soon as the environment running is exitted or closed it also stop capturing the keysrokes or stops working.
